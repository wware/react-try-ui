# Learn React by building a simple UI


This is how people are doing web apps these days. My Python skills are
outdated. I need to pick up Next.js and Node.js and all that. JS on both
the client and the server.

## [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server-side. It's used
for building web servers, APIs, microservices, and more.

## [React.js](https://react.dev/)

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's focused on the
client-side, handling how your application looks and interacts with users.

## [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated
web applications. It simplifies building React apps with features like routing,
data fetching, and optimized performance. 

## Functionality

### Node.js

Provides a foundation for building server-side applications. It offers a wide
range of modules and libraries for handling network requests, file system
operations, and other tasks.

### React.js

* Component-based architecture for reusable UI elements
* Virtual DOM for efficient updates
* Strong community support

### Next.js

* Extends the capabilities of React by providing features like:
* Server-side rendering (SSR): Renders React components on the server, improving SEO and performance.
* Static site generation (SSG): Generates HTML pages at build time, resulting in faster load times and better performance.
* Automatic code-splitting: Improves page load speed by loading only the necessary JavaScript code.
* File-based routing: Simplifies routing by using the file system structure.

## Use Cases

### Node.js

* Building APIs and microservices
* Creating real-time applications
* Developing command-line tools
* Building custom server-side logic

### React.js

* Building dynamic, interactive user interfaces
* Single-page applications (SPAs)
* Front-end development

### Next.js

* Building SEO-friendly web applications
* Creating fast and performant websites
* Developing e-commerce websites
* Building blogs and content-heavy websites

## How They Work Together

You can use Node.js as the backend for your React or Next.js application.
Next.js is built on top of React and uses Node.js under the hood.

### Choosing the Right Tool

* If you need to build a robust server-side application, choose Node.js.
* If you want to build a dynamic user interface, choose React.js.
* If you need a full-stack React framework with SSR and SSG, choose Next.js.
